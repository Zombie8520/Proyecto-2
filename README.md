# Proyecto-2
 
Pablo Alberto Ortiz Gutiérrez and  Luis Emilio Guillén Romo decide about the topic of heritage, so we add some of the codes that we have about the topic that we do on this class and also in other classes, so we add 5 codes:
-Autos
-Herencia
-Herenciamultiple
-Onepiece
-Tacos

Car: This code demonstrates the concept of inheritance, where specialized classes (AutoDeportivo, SUV) inherit properties and behaviors from a more general class (Auto). Additionally, it showcases polymorphism, where methods can be overridden in derived classes to exhibit specific behaviors while being called through base class references or pointers.

Inheritance: The code demonstrates how a derived class inherits attributes and methods from its base class while also having its own specialized attributes and methods. This concept allows for code reuse and the ability to create specialized behaviors for specific types of objects.

InheritanceMultiple: The code demonstrates how different types of professionals and employees inherit common functionalities from base classes while allowing specific behaviors to be defined in their respective derived classes. It showcases the principles of object-oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

OnePiece: This code illustrates the principles of inheritance and polymorphism by defining a base class with shared attributes and methods and creating derived classes with specific functionalities for pirates and marines.It´s based on the anime series OnePiece

Tacos:This code demonstrates the concept of inheritance and polymorphism in C++, allowing different taco types to have their specific preparation methods while sharing common functionalities from the base Taco class.
